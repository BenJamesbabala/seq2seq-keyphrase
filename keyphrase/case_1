[SOURCE]: newton s iteration and the sparse hensel algorithm extended abstract <eos> this paper presents an organization of the p adic lifting or hensel algorithm that differs from the organization previously presented by zassenhaus zas69 and currently used in algebraic manipulation circles mos73 yun74 wan75 mus75 <eos> our organization is somewhat more general than the earlier one and admits the improvements that yielded the sparse modular algorithm zip79 more easily than the zassenhaus algorithm <eos> from a pedagogical point of view the relationship between newton s iteration and the p adic algorithms is clearer in our formulation than with the zassenhaus algorithm
